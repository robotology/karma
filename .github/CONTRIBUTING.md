##### Sorry, we tend not to accept PR
The code hosted here was meant to run the self-contained experiment we called - some years ago by then - **`karma`**.

From that time, several developers took inspiration from this framework to further experiment on _affordances_ and so designed new features in terms of both motor control and vision processing in order to study their **specific problems** at hand. Although those contributions are valuable for us as well as for the authors, we deem that it is important to keep this **code untouched** and thus to reduce at minimum the chances to evolve it via external pull requests, especially because the proposed modifications are often not in line with the approach we would go for if we decide to implement the same functionalities.

Therefore, thanks to this restrictive policy, if in the future we will somehow aim to advance `karma`, we will be able to start from a point we perfectly know.

We also happened in the past to test some contributed code that appeared reasonable but didn't show the same robustness and whose modifications were so numerous that the only plausible and rapid solution was to reject it.
